  <h2> A computer, the internet, phones, social media 2</h2> 
They help connect the world, teach people things, discover new things, get inspired, create, innovate.<br>
All of this could be wonderful this is a tool to help us go about our lives.<br>
But we are dependent on it, we cannot go a day without technology.<br>
What about our phones? Not many people can say they don’t go on their phones even less people saying they can go a day without checking Instagram. <br>
The few that can are lucky.<br>
I,<br>
Unfortunately, <br>
Am not one of these people.<br>
I go to bed at 1:30 every night being on my phone or my computer<br>
		Derailing my sleep pattern and quality<br>
Stuck on the never-ending scrawling.<br>
Mindless and numbing.<br>

Instead of giving my body rest from my day and the overuse of the internet and social media, I scroll. And I cannot tell you why, nothing is brought from that endeavour.<br>
**Because of it I am creating a Thoughts of the field of computing? A manifesto? A proposal?**<br>
Maybe just a simple list on everything negative that happens from this electronic consummation.<br>
- I am not invested in moving my body
- I do not paint or draw
- I feel useless and mad at myself for having let myself fall so low
- 8+ hours on a screen a day
- No silence, series and films as WHITENOISE
- Losing capability to concentrate for a long period of time
- Procrastinating
- Muscle memories of the placements of my apps
- Reflex to check my phone
- Blinking lights = phone
- Seen as strange to not be on your phone in the tube

 
“Industrial societies and its future” was written by Ted Kaczynski in 1995 and firstly published in the Washington post. Ted Kaczynski is also known as the UNABOMBER an individual who mailed bombs to institutions that went against his view on society and how its technological and economical base should be eradicated. His manifesto critiques society and explains his view on it.
*“This system, he wrote, destroys nature and suppresses individual freedom. In short, humans adapt to machines rather than vice versa, resulting in a society hostile to human potential.”*

208. *Organization-dependent technology DOES regress when the social organization on which it depends breaks down. Example: When the Roman Empire fell apart the Romans’ small-scale technology survived because any clever village craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith could make steel by Roman methods, and so forth. But the Romans’ organization-dependent technology DID regress. Their aqueducts fell into disrepair and were never rebuilt. Their techniques of road construction were lost. The Roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten, so that not until rather recent times did the sanitation of European cities equal that of Ancient Rome.*

209. *The reason why technology has seemed always to progress is that, until perhaps a century or two before the Industrial Revolution, most technology was small-scale technology. But most of the technology developed since the Industrial Revolution is organization-dependent technology. Take the refrigerator for example. Without factory-made parts or the facilities of a post-industrial machine shop it would be virtually impossible for a handful of local craftsmen to build a refrigerator. If by some miracle they did succeed in building one it would be useless to them without a reliable source of electric power. So they would have to dam a stream and build a generator. Generators require large amounts of copper wire. Imagine trying to make that wire without modern machinery. And where would they get a gas suitable for refrigeration? It would be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking, as was done before the invention of the refrigerator.*


All of this is true, and I want to stop using this medium with such dependence, I don’t want to be in a psychological withdrawal each time I try not to use my phone for a long period of time. I want this to be a tool. **I using it** instead of **It using me**
And yet it is so difficult to do especially being an artist, to share my work to the world and gaining a following and connections and inspiration. All of this requires being on social media (my phone)

In 2017, an article in Rolling Stone stated that Kaczynski was an early adopter of the idea that:  "We give up a piece of ourselves whenever we adjust to conform to society's standards. That, and we're too plugged in. We're letting technology take over our lives, willingly."
